# Project 1

For sports fans, especially ones new to a city, it would be extremely useful to see all information related to the major local sports teams in one convenient dashboard. Users can enter their city of choice, then select filters that make finding the information they're interested in (i.e. next game, schedule, standings) super easy to find.

## User Story

```
AS AN avid sports fan
I WANT to know about all the local sports teams
SO THAT I can find out what the local sports schedules are
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN that I want to know what major sports teams are playing this weekend, and what their standings are

WHEN I enter a city name
THEN I'm presented with a check list of local teams with league information (i.e. NBA, MLS, NHL, etc.) that I can select from

WHEN I select which team(s) I'm interested in getting more information on
THEN I'm presented with a check list of possible team information filters (i.e. next game, schedule, standings, etc.)

WHEN I select my desired information type(s)
THEN I'm presented with that specific information for the team(s) I'm interested in
```
