# Project 1

For sports fans, especially ones new to a city, it would be extremely useful to see all information related to the major local sports teams in one convenient dashboard. Users can enter their city of choice, then select filters that make finding the information they're interested in (i.e. next game, schedule, standings) super easy to find.
